This is a python program that contains code for a anime tracking discord bot. 
It uses 3 tables (watching, watched and want_to_watch) and allows the user through discord to insert, delete, and view the contents of an SQL database.
The purpose of this program is to show personal skills in SQL, API usage, and python, and to have some sort of personal way of keeping track of anime.
